This repository comes with a utility package [parsakzr/codellm](https://github.com/parsakzr/codellm)
To install and use the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [repo-url]
cd [repo-name]
```

2. Install the dependencies

```

Optional: Also, if you want to run the notebooks, you need to install jupyter notebook.

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

## Usage

The directory structure of the project is as follows:

```bash
.
├── finetuning
│   ├── codegen
│   ├── humaneval
│   └── mbpp
├── evaluation
│   ├── evalanalysis.ipynb
│   ├── CodeGen
│   ├── mistral-code
│   ├── phi2-code
│   └── etc.
└── GUI
    ├── EvalModelOnGradio.ipynb
    ├── run.py
    └── etc.
```

- In the `finetuning` directory, you can find the code for the finetuning of the models. just run the notebooks in Colab, or locally.
- In the `evaluation` directory, you can find the code for the evaluation of the models.
- In the `GUI` directory, you can find the code to run the GUI. You can run the GUI by running the `run.py` file. or use the notebook to run it in Colab.

To run the UI

```bash
cd GUI
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```
